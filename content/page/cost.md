### TCO

Our customers often find multiple benefits from moving to the cloud, including agility, cost savings, and flexibility. Whether you run on AWS or own and operate your own infrastructure, there are many contributors to the overall cost. Weighing the financial considerations of owning and operating a data center (or renting a colocation facility) versus using a cloud infrastructure requires detailed and careful analysis.

Customers tell us that it can be challenging for them to perform accurate apples-to-apples cost comparisons between on-premises infrastructure and cloud. In reality, it is not as simple as just comparing on-premises hardware costs to the pay-as-you-go pricing model of compute, storage, and bandwidth in the cloud. The problem is further complicated by the fact that calculating the true, complete cost of owning and operating your own on-premises infrastructure is not trivial.

To make it easier for you to compare these costs, we are announcing the new AWS TCO calculator. This tool should help customers with a base level of familiarity with infrastructure to generate a fact-based apples-to-apples TCO comparison between on-premises infrastructure and AWS. 

### AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculators

AWS helps you reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by reducing the need to invest in large capital expenditures and providing a pay-as-you-go model that empowers you to invest in the capacity you need and use it only when the business requires it.

Our TCO calculators allow you to estimate the cost savings when using AWS and provide a detailed set of reports that can be used in executive presentations. The calculators also give you the option to modify assumptions that best meet your business needs.
