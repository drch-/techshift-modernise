### Lab Guide

#### Login to your AWS Console.

1) At the right top corner of the console, select a region that you will use for the remainder of these labs. All labs need to run in the same region. Select the closest region to you from the following regions to work in.
        
- EU (Ireland)
- Asia Pacific (Singapore)
- Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
- US East (N. Virginia)
- US East (Ohio)
- US West (Oregon)

Why only these regions? Not all services are available in all regions. During these labs, we will make use of the Cloud9 service to update our application code. Cloud9 is only available in the regions listed above. You can see what services are available in each region by visiting: [https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)

If you cannot select a region, you must first select a service that is not Global. For example, selecting the EC2 service will enable region selection.
